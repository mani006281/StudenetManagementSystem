The Student Management System is a simple Java application that helps manage student information using a menu-driven interface. Users can add, view, search, and delete student records by entering details like ID, name, age, and course. Data is stored in an ArrayList as Student objects, and user input is taken using a Scanner. The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit. It demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts and is ideal for beginners. While it only stores data in memory, it can be enhanced later to support file or database storage for real-world use.
